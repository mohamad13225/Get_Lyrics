Song: Numb Little Bug
Artist: Em Beihold

[00:10.68] I don't feel a single thing
[00:13.94] Have the pills done too much?
[00:16.68] Haven't caught up with my friends in weeks
[00:19.64] And now we're out of touch
[00:22.34] I've been driving in L.A.
[00:25.09] And the world, it feels too big
[00:27.99] Like a floating ball that's bound to break
[00:30.75] Snap my psyche like a twig
[00:33.64] And I just wanna see if you feel the same as me
[00:38.51] Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
[00:41.53] Like you're not really happy, but you don't wanna die
[00:44.16] Like you're hanging by a thread, but you gotta survive
[00:47.05] 'Cause you gotta survive
[00:49.85] Like your body's in the room, but you're not really there
[00:52.40] Like you have empathy inside, but you don't really care
[00:55.36] Like you're fresh out of love, but it's been in the air
[00:58.20] Am I past repair?
[01:00.59] A little bit tired of trying to care when I don't
[01:06.16] A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope
[01:11.88] A little bit tired of sinking, there's water in my boat
[01:15.57] I'm barely breathing, trying to stay afloat
[01:18.32] So, I've got these quick repairs to cope
[01:23.42] Guess I'm just broken and broke
[01:27.37] The prescription's on its way
[01:30.06] With a name I can't pronounce
[01:32.84] And the dose I gotta take
[01:35.76] Boy, I wish that I could count
[01:38.61] 'Cause I just want to see if this could make me happy
[01:43.46] Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
[01:46.28] Like you're not really happy, but you don't wanna die
[01:49.26] Like you're hanging by a thread, but you gotta survive
[01:51.95] 'Cause you gotta survive
[01:54.63] Like your body's in the room, but you're not really there
[01:57.44] Like you have empathy inside, but you don't really care
[02:00.50] Like you're fresh out of love, but it's been in the air
[02:03.38] Am I past repair?
[02:05.74] A little bit tired of trying to care when I don't
[02:11.29] A little bit tired of quick repairs to cope
[02:17.03] A little bit tired of sinking, there's water in my boat
[02:20.58] I'm barely breathing, trying to stay afloat
[02:23.11] So, I've got these quick repairs to cope
[02:28.56] Do you ever get a little bit tired of life?
[02:31.85] Like you're not really happy, but you don't wanna die
[02:35.06] Like a numb little bug that's gotta survive
[02:38.13] That's gotta survive
[02:39.35]
